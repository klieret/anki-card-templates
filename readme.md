# Anki Card Templates for learning Japanese

## Introduction to Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced repetition flashcard program.

Anki creates the (flash)*cards* automatically, based on the *notes* that the user adds (which basically are a collection of key-value pairs, called *fields*; [anki manual: basics](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics)). The information displayed on the cards and its styling is controlled by *templates*, which are written in HTML and CSS ([anki manual:cards & templates](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates)). 

In this repository I host the templates I created for studying Japanese.

Usually two cards are generated from each note: E.g. from a note containing the fields ```Kanji: 金```, ```Keyword: Gold```, I can generate a card asking for the kanji corresponding to the keyword "gold" or a card asking for the keyword corresponding to the kanji "金". This corresponds to two templates.
