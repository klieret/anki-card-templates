# Anki Card Templates for learning Japanese

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced repetition flashcard program.

Anki creates the (flash)*cards* automatically, based on the *notes* that the user adds (which basically are a collection of key-value pairs, called *fields*; [anki manual: basics](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics)). The information displayed on the cards and its styling is controlled by *templates*, which are written in HTML and CSS ([anki manual:cards & templates](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates)).

In this repository I host the templates I created for studying Japanese.
